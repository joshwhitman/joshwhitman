				<h1>About</h1>
				<article>
					<p>Hey there!</p>
					<p>I&rsquo;m Josh, and I&rsquo;m a <strong>QA analyst</strong> and <strong>digital developer</strong> with experience working in marketing, education, and technology/media. Thanks for taking the time to check out my site!</p>
					<p>I have worn many hats through the years, and I consider each as valuable as the last. As a <strong>student</strong>, I pursued liberal arts to the nth degree to gain as much knowledge as interested me. As a <strong>teacher</strong>, I spent a lot of my time improving processes and increasing the capabilities of my co-workers and students. As a <strong>designer</strong>, <strong>writer</strong>, and <strong>developer</strong>, I put ideas into action, seeking new skills whenever they become necessary. As a <strong>QA analyst</strong>, I follow projects to their audiences and help perfect the experience therein.</p>
					<p>In my spare time, I pursue creative projects and gain the skills necessary to complete them. These include writing fiction and nonfiction, creating websites with and for friends, drawing, and various craft projects (next, I&rsquo;m building a computer inside of a Gamecube). I enjoy creating new ways to introduce fun things into my life.</p>
					<h3>&mdash; <span>Josh</span></h3>
