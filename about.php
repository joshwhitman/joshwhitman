				<h1>about</h1>
				<p>Hey there!</p>
				<p>I’m Josh, and I’m a QA analyst and digital developer with experience working in marketing, education, and technology/media.</p>
				<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my site! The page you’re reading is an inventory of the skills and experience I’ve gained through the years in pursuit of my ever-changing Big Picture. One might call it a résumé.</p>
				<p>My Big Picture is about channeling my desire to create, improve, and build. As a student, I pursued liberal arts to the nth degree to gain as much knowledge as interested me. As a teacher, I spent a lot of my time improving processes and increasing the capabilities of my co-workers and students. As a designer, writer, and developer, I put ideas into action, seeking new skills whenever they become necessary. As a QA analyst, I follow projects to their audiences and help perfect the experience therein. </p>
				<p>In my spare time, I pursue creative projects and gain the skills necessary to complete them. These include writing fiction and nonfiction, creating websites with and for friends, drawing, and various craft projects (next, I’m building a computer inside of a Gamecube). I enjoy creating new ways to introduce fun things into my life.</p>
				<p>&mdash; Josh</p>
